# AI Model Used
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends
are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality. 

It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. 
Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend and typically handles outliers well.
